Azuga 

For the first time, drivers don’t resent behind-the-wheel behavior monitoring. They welcome it. Drivers don’t just bite the bullet to comply with rules—they actually compete to increase their safety scores. It’s automatic: no administration needed.

Azuga also helps reduce distracted driving, a factor in 28 percent of fleet accidents. We enable managers to monitor texting and calling while in motion. For many drivers, simply knowing this feature exists is enough to reduce cell phone use.

That’s along with everything else you expect from a top-rated GPS fleet tracking and monitoring provider: data, history, averages, and alarms on speeding, hard braking, hard acceleration, excessive idling and other safety and performance indicators.


Moreover, Driver behavior and roadway safety are both frequent factors in motorcoach crashes for long-distance travel. Our system will not only assess driver behavior but also record the roadway safety, which can benefit states and industry professionals in evaluating driving behavior and identifing the safety of rural routes that are utilized by motorcoaches.

Our system will reduces accidents and saves lives by turning drivers into safety experts, transforming the fleet culture into a safety culture. Our trailblazing mobile app shows drivers their real-time safety scores.
